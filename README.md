## Requirements
**Problem:**
- Must use at least one, and preferably two of the topics we have discussed during the course.
- Should include at least one new thing that was not directly taught in the lectures, but that you find and understand on your own

**Submission:**
- All of the relevant materials for your project (e.g. your report, jupyter notebook, and any data required for your code to be run) should be submitted on Learn. 
- If your data is too large to be submitted on Learn, then you can put it on github and provide a link in your submission

**Report:**
- 4.5 pages for groups of 5, allowed to go beyond this limit if this is due to including pictures, illustrations, tables etc
- The names of all the groups members should be clearly written on the title page of the report (which does not count towards the page limit)
